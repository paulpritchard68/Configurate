Configurate
===========
Configurate is a collection of config files and other scripts that configure the tools I use so that they suit me.

Installing the scripts
----------------------
install.sh is a very simple script to copy the files to the correct locations.
Run it once under your normal profle and then again as root

Notes
-----
filetype.vim and mysyntax.vim are included to support syntax highlighting for the IBM i and are based on files written by Martin Rowe
The actual syntax files can be found at: http://www.dbg400.net/foswiki/bin/view/DBG400/EditingWithVim#Syntax_checking
They will need to be downloaded to your ~/.vim folder
